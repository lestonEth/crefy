# Crefy - Decentralized Identity & Certification Platform

Crefy is a **decentralized identity and certification platform** that mints **certificates and KYC credentials as NFTs** on the blockchain. It ensures **secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof credentials**, allowing users to fully own and manage their digital identities.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/crefy.git
cd crefy
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev  # or yarn dev or pnpm dev or bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity:** Users can create and manage self-sovereign identities.
- **NFT-Based Certificates:** Institutions can issue verifiable credentials on-chain.
- **KYC as NFTs:** Secure and immutable KYC verification.
- **Blockchain Security:** Tamper-proof records with instant verification.
- **Seamless Integration:** API support for third-party applications.
